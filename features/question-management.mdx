# Question Management

Lexolingo provides flexible options for adding and managing quiz questions to suit different workflows and content volumes.

## Adding Individual Questions

The single question add feature allows you to create questions one at a time with a user-friendly form interface.

When adding a single question, you can specify:
- The subject, topic, and subtopic it belongs to
- Question text
- Multiple-choice options (typically 4)
- The correct answer
- An optional explanation that appears after answering

## Bulk Question Addition

For creating multiple questions at once, the bulk add feature streamlines the process:

```javascript
// Example of bulk question structure
const bulkQuestions = [
  {
    text: "Who is Luke Skywalker's father?",
    options: [
      "Obi-Wan Kenobi",
      "Darth Vader",
      "Emperor Palpatine",
      "Yoda"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1, // Index of correct option (Darth Vader)
    subtopicId: 12 // ID of the "Empire Strikes Back" subtopic
  },
  // More questions...
];
```

## CSV Import

For large question sets or migrating from other systems, Lexolingo supports importing questions from CSV files.

### CSV Format

The CSV import expects the following column structure:

```csv
Subject,Topic,Subtopic,Question,Option1,Option2,Option3,Option4,CorrectOption,Explanation
Characters,Jedi,Force Users,Who trained Luke Skywalker?,Obi-Wan Kenobi,Yoda,Both Obi-Wan and Yoda,Qui-Gon Jinn,3,Luke was initially trained by Obi-Wan and later by Yoda on Dagobah.
```

<Note>
If the specified subject, topic, or subtopic doesn't exist, Lexolingo will create it automatically during import.
</Note>

## Question Management

All questions can be edited, deleted, or moved between subtopics after creation. The question management interface provides filtering and search capabilities to quickly find specific questions.
