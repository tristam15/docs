## Key Responsive Features

### Touch-Optimized Interface

All interactive elements are designed with touch interactions in mind:

- Minimum touch target size of 44Ã—44 pixels
- Adequate spacing between interactive elements
- Swipe gestures for navigating between questions
- Large, easy-to-tap buttons for answering questions

### Adaptive Layouts

The application layout adapts intelligently based on screen size:

```css
/* Example of our responsive breakpoints */
:root {
  --breakpoint-sm: 640px;   /* Small smartphones */
  --breakpoint-md: 768px;   /* Large smartphones */
  --breakpoint-lg: 1024px;  /* Tablets */
  --breakpoint-xl: 1280px;  /* Desktops */
}
```

- Single-column layouts on small screens
- Multi-column layouts on larger screens
- Collapsible navigation on mobile devices
- Optimized font sizes and spacing for readability

### Performance Optimization

Mobile optimization extends beyond layout to performance:

- Optimized image loading and caching
- Minimal network requests
- Efficient rendering to conserve battery life
- Offline functionality for quiz-taking
